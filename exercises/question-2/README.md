# Question 2
## Create a class called time
has separate int member data for hours, minutes, and seconds.<br>
One constructor should initialize this data to 0 <br>
Another should initialize it to fixed values. <br>
Another member function should display it, in 11:59:59 format. <br>
The final member function should add two objects of type time passed as arguments. <br><br>

## IN main() 

A main() program should create two initialized time objects (should they be const ?) and one that isnâ€™t initialized.<br>
Then it should add the two initialized values together, leaving the
result in the third time variable.<br>
Finally it should display the value of this third variable.<br>
